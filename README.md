Human-Elephant conflict in Sri Lanka has become a serious economic and social problem. When comparing with other countries, Sri lanka has the highest elephant killing rate and the second highest human deaths due to the human-elephant conflicts. This paper proposes a modified and an efficient YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for real time detection of elephants with the ability to predict their future moves and notify it to the villagers who are in risk and wildlife authorities . YOLO-Maximus’s infrastructure is based on a modified and assembled YOLOv5 network. YOLO-Maximus its network trained and finetuned with a specific dataset with 170 videos and 4100 images which is especially made of data collected from Asian regions . With this dataset YOLO-maximus has achieved an accuracy of 94.5% on all tests.  Also, to improve the accuracy of detecting elephants with different sizes, the spatial pyramid pooling model is adopted to the YOLO- maximus network. When comparing with other Faster RCNN ( Region based Convolutional Neural Network) models for elephant detection, the average precision of this proposed network is 34%(on average) higher and it’s capable of predicting elephant’s future moves. Furthermore, the memory usage of YOLO-maximus is 79% (on average)lower than previously mentioned Faster RCNN for elephant detection.
